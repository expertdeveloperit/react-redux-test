#### A simple redux setup with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

### Basic application to show list of people and their details built with React & Redux

This simple application prototype shows how we can use React and Redux to build a friendly user experience.

## Features

- React, JSX, ES6, TypeScript and Flow syntax support.
- Language extras beyond ES6 like the object spread operator.
- Autoprefixed CSS, so you don’t need -webkit- or other prefixes.
- A fast interactive unit test runner with built-in support for coverage reporting.
- A live development server that warns about common mistakes.
- A build script to bundle JS, CSS, and images for production, with hashes and sourcemaps.
- An offline-first service worker and a web app manifest, meeting all the Progressive Web - - App criteria. (Note: Using the service worker is opt-in as of react-scripts@2.0.0 and higher)
- Hassle-free updates for the above tools with a single dependency.-

# Getting started

### Requirements

You’ll need to have Node 8.10.0 or later on your local development machine (but it’s not required on the server). You can use nvm (macOS/Linux) or nvm-windows to easily switch Node versions between different projects.
NPM

npm install or yarn
```

### Start the React App

Excute the following command:

```bash
